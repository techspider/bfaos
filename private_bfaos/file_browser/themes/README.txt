HOW TO INSTALL A THEME
----------------------

Themes are usually zipped but must be unzipped before you may use them.
For example, a theme named "mytheme.zip" must be unzipped to "mytheme/" with folders "file-icons" and "nav-icons" present.
The default theme can be changed either from the configurator or manually editing CONFIG.js in "private_bfaos/CONFIG.js"
